# Soapify

Need to quickly make a playlist for that middle school dance, but don't want to bother searching up clean versions? Say no more, because Soapify will do that for you! 

## Technologies Used
* React (with ES6 Javascript)
* Axios (promise-based HTTP client)
* Spotify Web API
* Node.JS

## What needs to be done
* States are unsynced with render function. Need to sync.
* implement "Add Clean Version" button which auto adds all clean songs to playlist
* Host using Heroku / Firebase so people can use it
* Bring the app out of development mode to allow more then 25 users
